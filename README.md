# SushiFinderBackendAPI
This is the backend API I'm planning to use for the most recent project "Sushi Finder". The backend is created with ExpressJS &amp; NodeJS +MongoDB. Also I have use some other dependencies as required such as mongoose etc. . The backend is connected with a live MongoDB. This backend consist of user model, ratings model, sushibars model so that the frontend can render data from the MongoDB. 

Routes : 
/api/login
/api/ratings
/api/register
/api/sushibars
