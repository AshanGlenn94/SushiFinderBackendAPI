# SushiFinderBackendAPI
This is the backend API I'm planning to use for the most recent project "Sushi Finder". The backend is created with ExpressJS &amp; NodeJS +MongoDB. Also I have use some other dependencies as required such as mongoose etc. . The backend is connected with a live MongoDB as well.
